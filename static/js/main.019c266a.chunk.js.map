Think of them as little beacons of hope, guiding you to safe zones on a night out. These flags will be hoisted outside licensed premises and indicate that the venue has met a certain standard of safety and security measures. By having these flags up, you'll be able to quickly identify venues that take safety seriously, so you can feel more secure and confident in your night-time activities.\",\n    \n          \"The Purple Flags safety system is a joint initiative by the state government and local councils, aimed at creating a safer and more enjoyable nightlife environment. It's not just about having a good time, it's about ensuring that everyone stays safe while they do so. The program will require venues to undergo regular assessments and audits to ensure that they continue to meet the safety standards.\",\n    \n          \"So, why is the Purple Flags safety system such a big deal for nightlife in New South Wales? For starters, it will help create a safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone.
